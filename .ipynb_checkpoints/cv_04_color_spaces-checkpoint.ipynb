Rotating one turn makes you go through all the colors and come back to the same. Value is the intensity. With Value=0 you have black no matter what value the other dimensions take. Saturation tells how saturated the color is. When Saturation is 0, Hue has no effect and we have a grayscale image, that changes from black (Value=0) to White (Value=Max).\nWhen you visualize the HSV channels you will see how the six squares in the top two rows that are fully saturated colors (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and cyan) all have Saturation=Max and Value=Max and that the black/white gradient at the bottom is unalterned when looking in the Value channel. We see the different colors showing up in the Hue channel as different values. If you move with the mouse over the images you can read off the intesity in the image at different pixels."
